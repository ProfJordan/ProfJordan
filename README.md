# Hello, I'm Jordan Halliday!
## I'm a full stack web developer & graphic designer

### 🚀 About Me
I'm deeply passionate about design and technology, a journey that started from my early days exploring art, typography, and coding, often creating artwork and programming games for friends and family.

My career has been diverse and exciting. After managing a photo department and dabbling as a tattoo apprentice, I discovered my true calling lies in creative design and computer science. I honed my skills in Media Design Technology, mastering programming and graphic design.

As a freelancer, I tackled projects in graphic design and web development, and managed my own small printing shop. Eventually, I joined an agency as a senior lead graphic designer. For five years, I crafted marketing, promotional, and advertising content for a company that presented national tours, Broadway shows, and concerts worldwide.

Following a company split, I established my own creative design studio, Pinebee Creative, serving a broad range of clients from small non-profits to major corporations.

### 👨‍🏫 Teaching & Sharing Knowledge
When I'm not working with clients, I teach Web Development & Graphic Design as an adjunct professor. This role has been a fantastic avenue to stay current with industry standards and mentor the next generation of designers and developers.

### 🏆 Accolades
I'm proud of the recognition my work has received, earning numerous awards in design competitions.

### 🌱 Currently Learning
I am pursuing a Professional Certificate in Computer Science for Web Programming from Harvardx to further enhance my skills.
